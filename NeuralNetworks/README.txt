Neural Networks

This script takes in exactly six arguments and runs using the following command structure:
python main.py <path_to_train_file> <path_to_test_file> <num_hidden_layers> <num_hidden_nodes> <learn_rate> <num_iter>

The script creates a Neural Network with exactly one output and trains on the data in train.dat using the given learning rate and number of training iterations
